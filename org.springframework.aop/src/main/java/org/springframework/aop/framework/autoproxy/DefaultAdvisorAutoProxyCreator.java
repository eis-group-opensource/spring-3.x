 * of this type in the same factory - by setting the <code>usePrefix</code> property
 * to true, in which case only advisors beginning with the DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator's
 * bean name followed by a dot (like "aapc.") will be used. This default prefix can be
 * changed from the bean name by setting the <code>advisorBeanNamePrefix</code> property.
 * The separator (.) will also be used in this case.
