 * Bean post-processors for use in ApplicationContexts to simplify AOP usage
 * by automatically creating AOP proxies without the need to use a ProxyFactoryBean.
 * 
 * <p>The various post-processors in this package need only be added to an ApplicationContext
 * (typically in an XML bean definition document) to automatically proxy selected beans.
 * 
 * <p><b>NB</b>: Automatic auto-proxying is not supported for BeanFactory implementations,
 * as post-processors beans are only automatically detected in application contexts.
 * Post-processors can be explicitly registered on a ConfigurableBeanFactory instead.
