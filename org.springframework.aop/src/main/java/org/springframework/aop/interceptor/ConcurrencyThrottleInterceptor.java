/**
 * Interceptor that throttles concurrent access, blocking invocations
 * if a specified concurrency limit is reached.
 *
 * <p>Can be applied to methods of local services that involve heavy use
 * of system resources, in a scenario where it is more efficient to
 * throttle concurrency for a specific service rather than restricting
 * the entire thread pool (e.g. the web container's thread pool).
 *
 * <p>The default concurrency limit of this interceptor is 1.
 * Specify the "concurrencyLimit" bean property to change this value.
