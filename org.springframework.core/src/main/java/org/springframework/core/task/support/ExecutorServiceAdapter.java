/**
 * Adapter that takes a Spring {@link org.springframework.core.task.TaskExecutor})
 * and exposes a full <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code> for it.
 *
 * <p>This is primarily for adapting to client components that communicate via the
 * <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code> API. It can also be used as
 * common ground between a local Spring <code>TaskExecutor</code> backend and a
 * JNDI-located <code>ManagedExecutorService</code> in a Java EE 6 environment.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This ExecutorService adapter does <em>not</em> support the
 * lifecycle methods in the <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code> API
 * ("shutdown()" etc), similar to a server-wide <code>ManagedExecutorService</code>
 * in a Java EE 6 environment. The lifecycle is always up to the backend pool,
 * with this adapter acting as an access-only proxy for that target pool.
