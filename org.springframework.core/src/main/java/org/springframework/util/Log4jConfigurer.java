/**
 * Convenience class that features simple methods for custom log4j configuration.
 *
 * <p>Only needed for non-default log4j initialization, for example with a custom
 * config location or a refresh interval. By default, log4j will simply read its
 * configuration from a "log4j.properties" or "log4j.xml" file in the root of
 * the classpath.
 *
 * <p>For web environments, the analogous Log4jWebConfigurer class can be found
 * in the web package, reading in its configuration from context-params in
 * <code>web.xml</code>. In a J2EE web application, log4j is usually set up
 * via Log4jConfigListener or Log4jConfigServlet, delegating to
 * Log4jWebConfigurer underneath.
