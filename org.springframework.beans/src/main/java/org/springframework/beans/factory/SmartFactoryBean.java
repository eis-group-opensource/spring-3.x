 * Extension of the {@link FactoryBean} interface. Implementations may
 * indicate whether they always return independent instances, for the
 * case where their {@link #isSingleton()} implementation returning
 * <code>false</code> does not clearly indicate independent instances.
 *
 * <p>Plain {@link FactoryBean} implementations which do not implement
 * this extended interface are simply assumed to always return independent
 * instances if their {@link #isSingleton()} implementation returns
 * <code>false</code>; the exposed object is only accessed on demand.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> This interface is a special purpose interface, mainly for
 * internal use within the framework and within collaborating frameworks.
 * In general, application-provided FactoryBeans should simply implement
 * the plain {@link FactoryBean} interface. New methods might be added
 * to this extended interface even in point releases.
