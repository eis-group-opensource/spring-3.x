/**
 * Interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in
 * a Spring {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory}) and containers
 * (typically a Spring {@link ApplicationContext}). Containers will propagate
 * start/stop signals to all components that apply.
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * will typically be defined with an
 * {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler},
 * restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>Note that the Lifecycle interface is only supported on <b>top-level singleton beans</b>.
 * On any other component, the Lifecycle interface will remain undetected and hence ignored.
 * Also, note that the extended {@link SmartLifecycle} interface provides more sophisticated
 * integration with the container's startup and shutdown phases.
