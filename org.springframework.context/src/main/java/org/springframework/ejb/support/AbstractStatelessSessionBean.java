/**
 * Convenient base class for EJB 2.x stateless session beans (SLSBs),
 * minimizing the work involved in implementing an SLSB and preventing
 * common errors. <b>Note that SLSBs are the most useful kind of EJB.</b>
 *
 * <p>As the ejbActivate() and ejbPassivate() methods cannot be invoked
 * on SLSBs, these methods are implemented to throw an exception and should
 * not be overriden by subclasses. (Unfortunately the EJB specification
 * forbids enforcing this by making EJB lifecycle methods final.)
 *
 * <p>There should be no need to override the <code>setSessionContext()</code>
 * or <code>ejbCreate()</code> lifecycle methods.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses are left to implement the <code>onEjbCreate()</code> method
 * to do whatever initialization they wish to do after their BeanFactory has
 * already been loaded, and is available from the <code>getBeanFactory()</code>
 * method.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the no-arg <code>ejbCreate()</code> method required
 * by the EJB specification, but not the SessionBean interface, eliminating
 * a common cause of EJB deployment failure.
